### Tech and Nature
Ten years ago I was running a tech startup that was working to upgrade the world’s public transport systems. It was groundbreaking and impactful work, but came with many hours in front of a computer (and sometimes scrambling across the roof of a city bus, or crawling on my belly under the seats!).

My remaining time was spent running a community garden (and my first soil site!), and a 1 acre urban farm in the center of my city that I'd started with some friends. So I was a transit-techie by day and had my hands in the dirt by evening and weekend... and in a sense, it was somewhat lonely. People around me were either into tech, or into nature, but rarely both.

But how times have changed, and today we are seeing more and more people who can embrace technology’s power while understanding and respecting nature, ecosystems, and our one and only biosphere. 

MakeSoil itself is an example of that integration. It uses just the right amount of technology to reconnect people with nature (and each other) in the physical world. For most, joining one of our 'soil sites' and watching their food waste turn into living Earth, is the first regenerative act they've ever participated in.

When people dig into an active compost heap and feel the tremendous heat 60ºC/140ºF pouring off of it, they are astounded. They look for a power cord, "Is this thing plugged in?" And slowly come to grips with the fact that it is the rich biodiversity at the microscopic level that is producing the heat, and generating new living soil.

In other words, we're using technology to scale a transformative experience, a gateway experience, into biodiversity and planetary regeneration. And for those who participate, that experience tends to forever shift their perception of technology, city-life, and so much more.

At-scale, it also offer cities a decentralized solution to their waste problem, turning a municipal obligation of keeping organics out of landfills, into a regenerative activity for citizens — a new possibility most cities are still unaware of.

With such a holistic and integrative mission, we at MakeSoil couldn't be more thrilled to be stewarding this initiative, which is ultimately powered by you. 

Please join us today by telling a friend, starting a soil site, or finding a soil site near you.

### Our first Soil Site in the Philippines appears

</br>

The local 'Bokashi Pinoy Composting' movement downloaded our free Soil Maker Box designs (https://www.makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box) and used them to build this beautiful box which is now the heart of a new community project: Tahanan Soil Site.

</div>
</br>

We just released this new design for a flyer that you can use to invite people to participate in the MakeSoil movement with you. This adds to our growing repository of campaign materials that you can download for free from our Resources page here: [makesoil.org/resources](https://www.makesoil.org/resources)

### Several New Soil Sites Suddenly Appear In The Middle East
</div>
</br>

Thanks to Local Activator Wendy Husband, we very quickly went from having no Soil Sites at all in Dubai, to now having 10 Soil Sites there (and 1 in Abu Dhabi). And we are now regularly seeing new users and Soil Sites coming online there organically.

As a decentralized movement, MakeSoil wants to invite and support you to become more than just a ‘user’ of another technology platform, but instead an active participant. Whether that's activating your local area, or just being proactive in recruiting Soil Supporters to contribute to your Soil Site, every new person taking part will in the end make a real positive difference.

## June 2019  

### Two New Features, Requested By You, Are Now Ready
</div>
</br>

#### 1. Appoint Another Soil Maker To Help You Manage Your Soil Site
</div>
</br>

You can now invite a new participant to become a Soil Maker of your Soil Site alongside you, or promote one of your existing Soil Supporters to the Soil Maker role. This gives them more control so they can help to manage the Site. You can even make a new Soil Maker the 'Primary Soil Maker', which means you are effectively handing over ownership of the Soil Site.

This is designed for:  

- Large Soil Sites (with lots of Soil Supporters), that need multiple Soil Makers to help manage the high volume of activity.
- Organizations whose team members manage several different Sites.

</div>
</br>

#### 2. Make Your Soil Site Invisible On The MakeSoil Map  
</div>
</br>

You can now 'hide' your Soil Site so that it no longer shows up on the MakeSoil map, nor in the search results.  

This is designed for:  

- Small Soil Sites that feel like they are already at max capacity and therefore don't want to attract any more Soil Supporters.
- Certain organizations (e.g. churches, apartment complexes) that prefer to keep their Soil Site and soil-making activity amongst their members.

### Two New Resources To Help You Make Soil In The Best Way  
</div>
</br>

#### 1. Get the Ultimate Soil Maker Box  
</div>
</br>

We now have a dedicated page where you can learn about the 'ultimate' Soil Maker Box that we have designed. Download the step-by-step guide and then either build it yourself, or find a woodworker near you who could do it for you: [makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box](https://www.makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box)
</div>
</br>

#### 2. Learn All You Need To Know About Making Soil  
</div>
</br>

We now have a 'Learn' section ([makesoil.org/learn](https://www.makesoil.org/learn)) where you can learn more about how to make soil, as well as about the MakeSoil vision and approach. It's easy to navigate by clicking the headings in the left-hand menu. And it also features some videos.

## May 2019  

### Two New Features To Help Soil Makers Get Soil Supporters  
</div>
</br>

#### 1. Download Personalized Poster (or Flyer) For Your Soil Site  
</div>
</br>

You can now download a ready-made, personalized poster advertising your Soil Site to passers-by in order to attract Soil Supporters. Please download the PDF, print it out, laminate it, and place it somewhere nice and visible near your Soil Site. Even better, once it's up, post a photo/video on social media and tag MakeSoil!  

P.S. If you print two to a page, you can use them as flyers to hand out in your neighborhood.

#### 2. Invite People To Participate In Your Soil Site  
</div>
</br>

You can now send personalized email invitations to multiple people with just one click.
