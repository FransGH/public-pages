### 2 New Features To Help Soil Makers Get Soil Supporters

#### 1. Download Personalized Poster For Your Soil Site
You can now download a ready-made, personalized poster advertising your Soil Site to passers-by in order to attract Soil Supporters. Please download the PDF, print it out, laminate it, and place it somewhere nice and visible near your Soil Site. Even better, once it's up, post a photo/video on social media and tag MakeSoil!

#### 2. Invite People To Participate In Your Soil Site
You can now send personalized email invitations to multiple people with just one click.
