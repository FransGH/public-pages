### Two New Resources To Help You Make Soil In The Best Possible Way
</ br>
#### 1. Get the Ultimate Soil Maker Box
</ br>
We now have a dedicated page where you can learn about the 'ultimate' Soil Maker Box that we have designed. Download the step-by-step guide and then either build it yourself, or find a woodworker near you who could do it for you: [makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box]

#### 2. Learn All You Need To Know About Making Soil
</ br>
We now have a 'Learn' section ([makesoil.org/learn]) where you can learn more about how to make soil, as well as about the MakeSoil vision and approach. It's easy to navigate by clicking the headings in the left-hand menu. And it also features some videos.

### Two New Features To Help Soil Makers Get Soil Supporters
</ br>
#### 1. Download Personalized Poster (or Flyer) For Your Soil Site
</ br>
You can now download a ready-made, personalized poster advertising your Soil Site to passers-by in order to attract Soil Supporters. Please download the PDF, print it out, laminate it, and place it somewhere nice and visible near your Soil Site. Even better, once it's up, post a photo/video on social media and tag MakeSoil!

P.S. If you print two to a page, you can use them as flyers to hand out in your neighborhood.

#### 2. Invite People To Participate In Your Soil Site
</ br>
You can now send personalized email invitations to multiple people with just one click.
