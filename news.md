### Two New Features, Requested By You, Have Now Been Released 

#### 1. Appoint Another Soil Maker To Help You Manage Your Soil Site
</ br>You can now invite a new participant to become a Soil Maker of your Soil Site alongside you, or promote one of your existing Soil Supporters to the Soil Maker role. This gives them more control so they can help to manage the Site. You can even make a new Soil Maker the 'Primary Soil Maker', which means you are effectively handing over ownership of the Soil Site.</ br>This is designed for:  

- Large Soil Sites (with lots of Soil Supporters), that need multiple Soil Makers to help manage the high volume of activity.
- Organizations whose team members manage several different Sites.

#### 2. Make Your Soil Site Invisible On The MakeSoil Map  

You can now 'hide' your Soil Site so that it no longer shows up on the MakeSoil map, nor in the search results.  

This is designed for:  

- Small Soil Sites that feel like they are already at max capacity and therefore don't want to attract any more Soil Supporters.
- Certain organizations (e.g. churches, apartment complexes) that prefer to keep their Soil Site and soil-making activity amongst their members.

### Two New Resources To Help You Make Soil In The Best Way  

#### 1. Get the Ultimate Soil Maker Box  

We now have a dedicated page where you can learn about the 'ultimate' Soil Maker Box that we have designed. Download the step-by-step guide and then either build it yourself, or find a woodworker near you who could do it for you: [makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box](https://www.makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box)

#### 2. Learn All You Need To Know About Making Soil  

We now have a 'Learn' section ([makesoil.org/learn](https://www.makesoil.org/learn)) where you can learn more about how to make soil, as well as about the MakeSoil vision and approach. It's easy to navigate by clicking the headings in the left-hand menu. And it also features some videos.

## May 2019  

### Two New Features To Help Soil Makers Get Soil Supporters  

#### 1. Download Personalized Poster (or Flyer) For Your Soil Site  

You can now download a ready-made, personalized poster advertising your Soil Site to passers-by in order to attract Soil Supporters. Please download the PDF, print it out, laminate it, and place it somewhere nice and visible near your Soil Site. Even better, once it's up, post a photo/video on social media and tag MakeSoil!  

P.S. If you print two to a page, you can use them as flyers to hand out in your neighborhood.

#### 2. Invite People To Participate In Your Soil Site  

You can now send personalized email invitations to multiple people with just one click.
