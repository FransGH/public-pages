# Soil Maker Bin
The Soil Maker Bin is the primary tool of the Soil Maker. This is where food scraps and carbon sources turn into living soil. Traditionally, a compost heap or pile was a good process to create soil, but that's not a suitable approach for many people today given limited space, dense urban environments, pests, and many other factors.

There are many commercially available "composters", or soil-making solutions, available for purchase, but most fall short due to complexity of use, limited capacity, limited airflow, difficulty in harvesting, requiring turning, and more.

MakeSoil has developed a Soil Maker Bin that takes the best knowledge we have about making soil and combines it with clever features so that anyone with a little bit of space can start making soil in their own home. 

The MakeSoil Soil Maker Bin design is free-to-use for personal use, and requires a $20 USD donation if you'd like to use the designs to sell bins.
