# How can I make soil?

There are many different ways to make soil. However, we consider the thermophilic, microbial soil-making process - commonly referred to as ‘hot’ composting - to be the most versatile and robust. In this process, the Soil Site could ideally reach temperatures of around 130°F (54°C), supporting many different microbes as they voraciously chew and digest the materials in a Soil Site, which is what ultimately turns those materials into what we recognise as soil. 

This ‘hot’ process is able to handle most typical household waste, as well as a diversity of inputs from neighbors and the surrounding community e.g. coffee shops, restaurants, workplaces etc.

Then there are 4 general principles to keep in mind when making soil:

#### 1) The Carbon to Nitrogen ratio

There should be 30 parts of carbon to every 1 part of nitrogen. Said another way, 3 parts ‘brown’ or ‘dry’ stuff (e.g. sawdust, dry leaves and paper) for every 1 part ‘green’ or ‘wet’ stuff (e.g. banana peels, apple cores, coffee grounds). 

While that may sound daunting, it will quickly become intuitive: If it’s too moist and starting to smell, you need more high-carbon materials. If it’s dry and lifeless and not turning into soil, you need more high-nitrogen materials.

#### 2) Airflow

There should be sufficient airflow through the Soil Site bin, and generally the more, the better. This can be achieved, for instance, by ensuring that there are small gaps between the panels of your bin, or by having one side made of chicken wire.

#### 3) Moisture

The Soil Site should be sufficiently moist, but not too wet. Covering the Soil Site or at the very least keeping a layer of high-carbon matter on top, will help prevent your Soil Site from becoming dried out in hot, sunny conditions, or from becoming too moist when it rains.

If the Soil Site remains too dry, either add more moist, high-nitrogen scraps (e.g. coffee grounds) or water.

#### 4) Volume

One last point to consider is that you can’t make soil in a coffee cup! For a hot process, there needs to be a sufficient thermal mass - ensure your Soil Site is at least a few feet in diameter.
