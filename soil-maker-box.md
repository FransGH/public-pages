# Soil Maker Box

We designed our own Soil Maker Box and  made the design freely-available (see links below).

- Pest-proof
- Large volume for lots of materials
- Maximizes airflow for hot composting
- Minimizes the need for turning
- Easy to harvest finished soil

Build it yourself, have someone build it for you, or if you're a woodworker consider building it for other people, and even selling it. All we ask is that if you make any profits from our design, please make a donation to MakeSoil to show your appreciation.
