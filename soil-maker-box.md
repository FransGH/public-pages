# Soil Maker Box

We designed our own Soil Maker Box and  made the design freely-available (see links below).

- Pest-proof
- Large volume for lots of materials
- Maximizes airflow for hot composting
- Minimizes the need for turning
- Easy to harvest finished soil

If you'd like to have one, please send the design to a local woodworker or maker and ask them to build it for you. MakeSoil does not build or sell these ourselves. 

And if you're a woodworker or maker, feel free to post the design on your website or social media pages. All we ask is that if you make any profits from our design, please make a donation to MakeSoil to show your appreciation.
