# Soil Maker Box

We designed our own Soil Maker Box and have made the design freely-available to makers around the world (see links below).

If you'd like to have one, please send the design to a local woodworker or maker and ask them to build it for you. MakeSoil does not build or sell these ourselves. 

And if you're a woodworker or maker, feel free to post the design on your website or social media pages. All we ask is that if you do make any profits from our design, please consider making a donation to MakeSoil <p><a href="/donate">here</a>.

- Pest-proof
- Large volume for lots of materials
- Maximizes airflow for hot composting
- Minimizes the need for turning
- Easy to harvest finished soil
