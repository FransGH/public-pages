I have been composting since I was a child. I grew up on a farm and my parents had a small sawmill, so we had huge composting piles with equipment to turn and apply it. I have been composting in an urban setting for almost 10 years at a larger than usual backyard scale, and now process at least 1 yard of finished compost per month. I have been actively giving composting lessons and consulting professionally for just over a year, including remotely via Zoom. Between multiple topics, my group has taught 60 composting classes in 16 months. I was the instructor for 75% of them.
 
I am passionate about composting because it is just the way our organic waste should be handled. It is not waste, it's a resource that is not being utilized to its fullest potential. Whether you are growing food, applying to lawns or landscapes, or just making a heap in the corner, it is preferable to tossing it in the trash to rot and release greenhouse gases.
 
I have a number of different composting systems that I use or instruct with. My preferred method is a simple hardware cloth ring, but that is for large volumes in an area shielded from public view. I also use a tumbler, and a closed container open on the bottom. I am working with a client now to build up to small windrows, and have taught a number of classes using the MakeSoil bin design as a model composter.

I began composting 10 years ago with a single purchased bin but quickly outgrew its capacities. After attending a 6 month commercial ag program with Growing Power I shifted my methods to larger scale production using a 3 bin pallet set up for passive no turn piles and windrow composting for quick turnover production (all of my approaches use hot composting). I also started using a passive vermicomposting process which feeds the worms my finished compost rather than fresh food scraps.
 
I currently have two Soil Sites on MakeSoil.org and will be adding a third once my new location is ready. I work with local breweries and coffee shops to compost their waste and typically collect 25+ 5-gallon buckets of waste a week in addition to my personal waste and my MakeSoil supporter contributions.
 
I am the owner of The Urban Harvest which teaches the basics of sustainable vegetable gardening here in Florida. I teach classes and workshops all over our county, do private consultations, and produce weekly Florida vegetable gardening videos.
 
Quality soil is the absolute best way to grow a bountiful garden and composting is the best way to build that soil. Our modern agricultural system needs to change, that means growing where the people are (even in urban settings) and taking a restorative approach where we work in fluid balance with nature. The more people who know how to grow soil the better!
