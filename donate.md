MakeSoil is scaling the incredibly simple but effective act of making soil together, worldwide. Because it is so actionable and able to be implemented by just about anyone, anwhere, it stands to become one of the most effective social and environmental initiatives of the decade. But we need your help.

MakeSoil is a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization existing 100% for the public, planetary good. It can never be acquried by a for-profit corporation and has no stock to trade or shares to raid. Accordingly, we depend on charitable, philanthropic donations from people like you to grow this planet-repairing movement.
