# Donate to MakeSoil
MakeSoil is a non-profit organization with the goal of mobilizing humanity to make soil together on a planet-saving scale. We're lean and agile, and like any other organization, we need money to accomplish our goals. MakeSoil is a 501(c)(3) in the United States, which means that donations are tax-deductible in the US and many other countries.

If you can't afford to make a monetary contribution, the best support you can give us is to become a Soil Maker or Soil Supporter yourself, inviting your neighbors and friends to participate with you, as well as sharing MakeSoil far and wide.

Thank you for being a part of MakeSoil!
