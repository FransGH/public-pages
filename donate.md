# Donate to MakeSoil
MakeSoil is a non-profit organization with the goal to get as many people as possible making soil together on a planet-saving scale.

MakeSoil is a non-profit organization with the goal of making soil together on a planet-saving scale. We're lean and agile, and like any other organization, we need money to accomplish our goals.

If you can't afford to make a monetary contribution, the best support you can give us is to make soil yourself and invite your neighbors and friends to become soil supporters, as well as sharing MakeSoil far and wide.

Thank you for being a part of MakeSoil!
