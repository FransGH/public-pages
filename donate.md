# Please support MakeSoil with a donation

_MakeSoil is a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization. Donations are tax-deductible for US taxpayers._

Any amount is helpful. Nothing is too small, or too large.

Now more than ever, with the disruptions challenging humanity, the world needs _healthier_ people, more _resilient_ communities, a more _local_ food system, and an economy that works in _harmony_ with nature.

MakeSoil is a _powerful_ way to achieve this, but we are in need of donations to maintain our efforts. Can you help? 

Whatever you can give will go directly to scaling the global movement of communities making soil together, growing food, and establishing a new decentralized food system that is better for us and easier on our planet too.

You can donate via card, PayPal, bank transfer, check or a donor-advised fund. Scroll down for these options.
