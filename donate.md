MakeSoil is scaling the incredibly simple but effective act of making soil together, worldwide. But we need your help.

We are a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit that exists 100% for the public, planetary good. MakeSoil can never be acquried by a for-profit corporation and has no stock to trade or shares to raid. Accordingly, we depend on charitable, philanthropic donations from people like you to grow this planet-repairing movement.




### Amazon Smile  

Let's start with something that won't cost you a penny. Most people shop at Amazon. Well now you can ensure that a portion of every purchase supports MakeSoil's planetary regeneration (at no cost to you!). It really does add up, so if you want to do something good for the Planet, please take 2 mins to do this!

_Step 2_ — Always remember to start your Amazon shopping from https://smile.amazon.com

_Step 3_ — Believe us, no one remembers step two! Not even us! _Please_ install one of the browser extensions below so you won't have to remember. These extensions do **not** collect any of your data — they just redirect Amazon to Amazon Smile and _will not_ alter your shopping experience.
