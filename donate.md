# Please help us with a donation

More than ever in this time of the virus, the world needs _healthier_ people, more _resilient_ communities, a more _local_ food system, and an economy that works in _harmony_ with nature.

Any amount is helpful. Nothing is too small, or too large.

Whatever funds you give will go directly to scaling the global movement of communities making soil together, growing food, and establishing a new decentralized food system that is better for us and easier on our planet too.

You can donate via card, PayPal, bank transfer, check or a donor-advised fund. Scroll down for these options.
