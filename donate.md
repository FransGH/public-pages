# Please support MakeSoil with a donation

_MakeSoil is a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization. Donations are tax-deductible for US taxpayers._

We are currently aiming to raise $750,000, in order to grow to 2,000 "soil sites" in 2023.

This would result in the following impact:

- 6,000 tons/year organic matter rescued
- 4,000 tons/year GHGs prevented
- 300 tons/year new soil created
- 200 new food gardens started
- 10,000 neighbors brought together

Now more than ever, with the disruptions challenging humanity, the world needs _healthier_ people, more _resilient_ communities, a more _local_ food system, and an economy that works in _harmony_ with nature.

MakeSoil is a _powerful_ way to achieve this, but we need your support to fulfil our mission. Can you help?
