# MakeSoil Resources

Want to be a part of spreading MakeSoil far and wide? These are some resources you can use to raise awareness, activate Soil Makers, and get Soil Supporters to start contributing their food scraps and carbon sources to Soil Sites.

## Tear-Off Flyers

Great for putting on poster-boards and anywhere else people might be looking for information or connections.

## Flyers (or Postcards!)

How can someone not make soil with you after you hand them this? You can print this at home to hand out to neighbors and friends, or even better for the trees and the environment, share it on Social Media!
