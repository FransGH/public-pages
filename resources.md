# MakeSoil Resources
Want to be a part of spreading MakeSoil far and wide? These are some resources you can use to raise awareness, activate Soil Makers, and get Soil Supporters to start contributing their food scraps and carbon sources to Soil Sites.

## Tear-Off Flyer
Great for putting on poster-boards and anywhere else people might be looking for information or connections.


## Cards
Print-at-home cards are a great way to strike up conversations and get people interested in MakeSoil.
