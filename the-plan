# Where to Go From Here
## A Local-Global Transition Plan in the Time of the Virus

I wrote a post recently urging humanity to see the virus as an opportunity to change. It resonated widely and was shared many times, but didn’t offer a more clear path of how to proceed. This post is about how to organize ourselves toward meaningful action before the energy of that sentiment dissipates and the opportunity is missed.

To recap briefly, now is the perfect time to change our relationship with the economy, the biosphere, and each other.

Why? Because...

1. Today’s economy grows and expands by consuming and destroying the only living biosphere in the known universe.

2. We have become so dependent on this economy that we find it too frightening to make any real changes to it or do anything other than help accelerate and expand it.

3. We have completely forgotten that, in reality, the biosphere is actually more important to our survival than the economy.

It is also the case right now that while few people understand the economy, even fewer understand the biosphere. The biosphere is a complex living organism inside of which we live our lives and conduct all our business and activities. It is made up of countless networks of living organisms that provide us with everything from food that sustains us to the very process of evolution itself which birthed us. It includes an atmosphere, so we can breathe and enjoy the sun’s warmth, and a magnetic field that protects us from cosmic radiation. And if you sufficiently disrupt any of the aforementioned qualities of the biosphere, we will die.

Whenever you see pictures of another planet, like Mars, realize that it has no biosphere. No other planet in the solar system does. All the other planets are completely dead.

If you believe in God or some other organizing force of grandeur, then the biosphere could be seen as the most extraordinary gift ever given to anyone anywhere. If you don’t believe in God or any such force, then the Biosphere is the most god-like thing you will ever encounter, for it is by its existence that you live and breathe.

The Biosphere is more important than the economy.

But thanks to our collective efforts to rapidly and endlessly grow the economy, this biosphere is quickly destabilizing. Pollution at every turn, biodiversity loss, the extinction of species, rising sea levels, increasingly volatile weather, numerous public health crises, pandemics… these are the symptoms, the painful groanings of a damaged and destabilizing Biosphere.

Whenever you run into someone who tells you that everything is getting better and that we’re better off than we’ve ever been, they’re mostly referring to the unprecedented availability of goods and services, the increasing prevalence of money, credit, bank accounts, and other fixations of the human ego. And they have almost no understanding of the Biosphere.

Our history and education system is such that a person today can have advanced degrees in engineering, a PhD in physics, a Nobel prize in economics, or a hundred million dollars in the bank, while knowing almost nothing about the Biosphere.

It’s not that we’re stupid. It’s just that the Biosphere has so far been invisible to industrial society — too big to perceive. Nothing but raw materials everywhere to be endlessly harvested by whatever means and in whatever quantity for our various activities and industries.

Remember, it was only about 50 years ago that the first pictures of the whole Biosphere from space were even taken. And this situation of ours that it depicts, us riding on a living blue ball hanging in an inhospitable vacuum of space surrounded by dead planets, and all the implications of that, have yet to fully sink in.

Accordingly, we as a people have failed to reign in the economy’s destructive tendencies. We have failed to transition the economy into something harmonious with the biosphere. We have lacked the collective will, the consciousness, the time, the attention, the discipline, the courage, the detachment, the awareness... to tame the economic juggernaut.

And now, the Virus.

What a blow this invisible microbe is dealing to our economy. Once you begin to perceive the Biosphere, the Virus begins to look a lot like an immune response, a swarm of antibodies set against us and our out-of-control economy.

Most incredibly, the Virus actually seems to be making us choose now between the economy and our own survival. Conduct business as usual and we risk infecting ourselves and our loved ones. Stop business as usual and our income suffers, our jobs are cut, our retirement funds evaporate, our stock markets crash.

If the virus could talk it might say one word. “Checkmate.”

And as the economy suffers? We see the skies clearing, the air becoming more breathable, animal populations rising, all signs of the Biosphere beginning to heal and repair itself, like any living creature does when it is finally allowed to rest.

The only way forward now is to bring the economy into harmony with the Biosphere. All proposed solutions that do not address the fundamental disharmony between the economy and the biosphere are illegitimate.

If we do not do so now, we will only have to do so later. The longer we wait the more painful the adjustment will be.  So let’s do it now, while the virus is violently doing to the economy what we have failed to peacefully do ourselves.

Now is the perfect time. It will seem frightening at first, but the truth is that we can soon be having an even better, more enjoyable, time than we were having before, and be on track for a more secure, and more meaningful future than we previously were.

So what must we actually do? First we must reduce our dependence on “the economy”. We must reduce the economy’s stranglehold on us. We must do so as quickly as we can to give ourselves the breathing room to think clearly, to make the right changes, and to set up new more reliable systems on which to depend going forward.

If we cannot take a step back from today’s economy, if we cannot even momentarily reduce our complete and total dependance on it, we will remain too feeble-minded, hard-hearted, insecure, and conflict-prone to work together in a coherent direction, let alone to learn anything about and do anything sensible about the Biosphere, which is the heart of the matter.

To be clear, this step of reducing our dependence on the economy is not a political plan to dismantle capitalism or establish socialism or communism or any other kind of ism. Such systems may forever come and go and ebb and flow as societal overlays within the Biosphere.

The opportunity here, is more foundational than swapping one human-made economic or political system for another. The opportunity here is to enter into a symbiotic relationship with the living Biosphere that made humans.

Where to begin?

The way to begin is with a dramatic shift in the food system. Why food? Because people who are starving or are even remotely afraid of starving (anyone “stock up” at the grocery store recently?) do not have the presence of mind or level of consciousness required to make the transition.

To put it plainly, the sight of empty shelves at the grocery store fills people with self-centeredness and fear. In contrast, the sight of gardens fills people, not only with food, but with feelings of calm and peace.

Imagine a million new gardens around the world, every year. If we see food being grown everywhere as we walk around our cities and sit on our balconies and visit our neighbors, we will have the calmness of mind and resolve to take that step back and transition the economy. If instead what we see are empty store-shelves, and warily guarded shopping carts, we will not.

The food system is also one of the most dysfunctional of all human institutions right now, taking a massive toll on our health, on our bodies, and on the Biosphere. Our food system is also one of the greatest causes of suffering to the Earth’s other inhabitants, be they the animals raised with industrial cruelty for cheap meat, or the wild bats and snakes dragged out of the jungle and bound for a wet-market where the first human would contract the Virus.

A new, decentralized food system is the one thing that can immediately alleviate the environmental burden of our intense activity on the Biosphere, while reducing the amount of animal suffering in the world, while providing us with immediate sustenance as supply chains are interrupted, while reducing our own suffering and giving us peace of mind and the iota of independence we need in order to crawl out from under the economy’s thumb.

A new decentralized food system is the one thing that we can initiate right now, inexpensively and independently, without government intervention. The support of one’s immediate neighbors is at most, what’s needed. A new decentralized food system is the one thing that every single person can take action on right now, without delay.

A new food system, citizen powered and decentralized is, therefore, the single greatest, most immediate, and most actionable leverage point available to us at this time.

If you’re ready to get started, read on.

Step 1 — Stop all organic matter from leaving our neighborhoods  

Organic matter means (food scraps, soiled paper, yard stuff). Pretty much anything that isn’t plastic, styrofoam, metal, or glass. Stuff that is essentially the remains of plants or animals, everything from banana peels and coffee grounds to used paper towels and coffee filters.  

Contrary to common perception, this stuff turns out to not be garbage or waste or something to get rid of at all; it turns out to be nutrients and energy.

It doesn’t look that way to most of us because we were desensitized to its true nature starting in childhood with every toss into the garbage can. So now it just looks like life-less, inconsequential matter to be mindlessly gotten rid of, when it is actually the key to our liberation.

  Today this misunderstood matter leaves our neighborhoods in one of two ways. Firstly, most of it, in most places, leaves as trash. You know the drill — first it goes into big plastic bags and then gets picked up by a big truck that gets 3 mpg and dumped in a landfill that no one wants to live near. Once there, it will turn into methane and CO2 and float up into the atmosphere, where it exacerbates many global problems and further imbalances the Biosphere.

This must stop. The Earth does not belong in a trash can.

Yet for all of the high-minded environmentalism and idealistic patriotism, for all of our professed love of The Planet, Earth, Mother, Gaia, Our Country, or whatever it is we profess to love… most people, in most places, take that supposedly beloved Planet-Earth-Mother-Gaia-Country, and toss or scrape it into the waste bin at least three times a day. We treat the planet like garbage. Literally.

  The other way organic matter leaves our neighborhoods is through municipal compost programs. These programs are a good attempt at doing something better than making trash but they will not bring about the transformation we now require. Not only do they also require giant fuel-burning trucks to go up and down each city street, they also keep up the illusion that taking care of the Biosphere is someone else’s responsibility.

We must leave behind the box and bin culture, where stuff arrives in a box on our doorstep and leaves in a bin by the curb. In the box and bin culture we never learn how the planet works or our part in it, which is the only real way out of this mess.

  So again, step one is that we stop needlessly making garbage and stop relying on programs to take away the waste that isn’t actually waste. Step one is keeping all the energy and nourishment stored in that organic matter from leaving our neighborhoods. 

Step 2 — Turn that organic matter into soil

In Step 2 we turn all that stuff from Step 1 into soil. And we do it right in our neighborhoods. Why soil? Because it’s a way to store all that energy and nutrient in a stable, odorless form, ready and waiting to be turned into food.

Beyond that, that soil provides a home to countless microbes, the biodiversity of which helps protect the food supply and generally boosts the health and life of the Biosphere.

Why do it ourselves in our own neighborhoods? Because humanity must have the hands-on experience of regenerating the Biosphere directly. That’s what we get when we participate directly in making soil. We create new, living Earth, and from that moment on we see ourselves differently: no longer just a consumer, but a regenerator.

As for how to effectively organize us around an activity that few people know how to do, a dash of technology here can really help. That’s what you’ll find at MakeSoil.org. Think of MakeSoil as an operating system for planetary regeneration. It’s still in its early stages, but right now it offers a basic way for everyone to begin organizing and effectively moving forward. You don’t have to do it alone, and you don’t have to know what you’re doing. Just go to MakeSoil and find a Soil Site near you.

Step 3 — Use that soil to start millions of gardens of every size and shape, everywhere.

Right now there’s enough organic matter going to landfills that could instead be used to start several million new gardens — every single year.

So Step 3 is that we start those millions of new gardens, right now. That means you, me, everyone. If you can grow one plant in a pot on your balcony, grow one. If you can grow 10, grow 10. But the idea is for every single person to grow something. Something edible, that is. The time devoted can be as little as 10 minutes a week, or many delightful hours.

This begins effectively decentralizing the food system and helps us shed our ignorance of where food comes from and how it is created. It begins bringing each person back into a symbiotic relationship with Earth and its many other life forms.

  It doesn't mean growing all of your food, but neither does it mean growing none of your food. It is time to be somewhere (anywhere!) in-between those two extremes.

And remember, you won’t be doing it alone as part of some isolationist compound or apocalyptic future, you’re doing it alongside billions of other people in a friendly and distributed manner, specifically so we don’t end up with an isolationist society or apocalyptic future.  

Step 4 — Give, trade, buy and sell that food to each other  

This is not about growing and selling enough food to quit your day-job; it’s about becoming one iota less dependent on that day-job for your complete survival. It’s about creating a resilient web of relationships with your neighbors. It’s about beginning to depend less on the abstract, uncontrollable economy and more on each other and on the Biosphere directly. It’s about getting that first refreshing taste of a more regenerative, less convoluted economy. Being in such a relationship with the Earth and each other adds to our safety and security in ways that money can’t. 

Then, if the economy stumbles, instead of worrying and being filled with fear, we instead come home to that little bit of food we’re growing, and our friends come over with some food that they’re growing, and we sit around and reflect on what we liked about our job and what we really didn’t and what else we might want to do with ourselves now that we have some time to learn and try something new.

Once all of this is happening we will have done something very important. We will have made society and our lives far more resilient, able to handle the ups and downs of the economy, no longer at its total mercy, and therefore free to make changes to it.

Lastly, our symbiosis with the Biosphere can go far, far beyond this. No one really knows what’s possible when 8 billion creative and intelligent humans partner fully with the only living Biosphere in the known universe. But finding out together will be far more exciting than endlessly growing the economy ever was.
