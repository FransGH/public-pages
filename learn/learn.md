MakeSoil is a nonprofit online platform that matches ‘Soil Makers’ (people who compost) with nearby ‘Soil Supporters’ (people who contribute scraps).

This gets local people working together with nature to reverse climate change, while also making the rich soil we need to grow healthy local food for everyone.

MakeSoil is a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization. We re-invest any surplus funds back into our mission.

# How did MakeSoil start?

In 2009, MakeSoil founder [Josh Whiton](http://joshwhiton.com/) was living in a suburban apartment block in the city of Raleigh, North Carolina in the United States. He noticed that all the residents there were just throwing all their waste into the trash, which would be taken away to sprawling landfill sites outside the city.

Josh was sure there was a more beautiful way to do things. So, one day, he found some discarded wooden pallets, fixed them together to make a compost bin outside his building, and went door-to-door inviting his fellow residents to donate their food scraps to him.

People soon got the idea, and were glad to have a clear, simple and practical way to do something good for the planet. And as Josh began to master the art of making soil, they were even more amazed to see how quickly all sorts of organic materials could be turned back into rich, living soil.

And now that they had direct access to good quality soil, it wasn't long before they all came together to create a beautiful community garden too (see video below), all starting from simple food scraps.

Josh was himself amazed to watch all of this unfold, as he gradually began to fully realise the great potential of this simple yet profound act - of making soil together - to inspire people, to bring them together, and to repair our relationship with our planet, all at the same time:

"I'm still in awe of the transformations I saw in people as they began to participate in the process and have that experience of making soil. It was unexpected and profound. Despite having been the CEO of a successful tech startup, building that compost bin and inviting people to use it, is perhaps the simplest thing I've ever done that had the greatest benefit."

It's the simple desire to share this experience, that gave birth to MakeSoil.

## Build Resilient Communities

Healthy soil has become rare and valuable in today’s world. By making soil together ourselves, out of the food and yard scraps in our own neighborhoods, we can save money and even generate new income and jobs. We can also use this soil to grow our own healthy food, becoming more self-sufficient and less reliant on the fragile industrial food system.

## Transform Your Understanding

Watching our food and yard scraps turn back into living soil (instead of just throwing them in the trash), completes an essential feedback loop which transforms our understanding and relationship with our surroundings. Not only does this boost our personal sense of wellbeing, but we also begin to realize more fully how our current system works as a whole, and the role we play in this system as individuals.

## Regenerate The Planet

We need to start regenerating the planet, rather than simply consuming it as a raw material. Our society produces an enormous amount of food waste. Currently, nearly all of it goes to landfills where it rots, releasing CO2 and methane — an even worse greenhouse gas. When instead we turn that food waste into soil, the carbon and nutrients go into the ground, capturing carbon, while producing the topsoil our food system depends on.

# How does MakeSoil compare with using a municipal (or commercial) composting pick-up service?

Pick-up services can of course be a convenient option for many people, and MakeSoil loves to work with both municipalities and waste companies to support and supplement what they do. However, the MakeSoil approach is to create a decentralized network of Soil Sites where citizens' scraps are composted at the most local level possible, saving time, fuel and money while also building greater community resilience.

Watching your food waste turn back into living soil also completes an essential feedback loop which suddenly transforms your understanding and relationship with the environment. When somebody else takes away your food waste and composts it for you out of sight, it's certainly better than those scraps being sent to landfill. However, you do miss out on the transformative experience that can only come through completing such feedback loops.

We live today in a box and bin culture. We click a button on the internet, a box arrives on our doorstep, we play with it for a while or it breaks, and then we throw it in a bin and someone takes it away. This keeps us from understanding the system we live in as a whole. MakeSoil is founded on the insight that it’s only by witnessing and fully participating - from start to finish - in regenerative acts like soil making, that we can begin to truly recognize how our system works, and the role we play in this system as individuals.

# What is a Soil Maker?

A Soil Maker is someone who knows how to turn scraps and leftovers into soil - or is willing to learn - and who operates a Soil Site where they invite one or more neighbors to participate.

# What is a Soil Site?

A Soil Site is a physical place where people come together to turn their food scraps into soil. Soil Sites can be hosted by anyone who knows how (or is learning how) to make soil. All that is needed is a Soil Maker Box, located in a backyard (or front-yard), or place of worship or place of work, which is then registered here at MakeSoil.org.

MakeSoil then makes it safe and easy to invite neighbors and friends to bring their food scraps, and to collaborate in this beautiful, important, and regenerative act.

# What is a Soil Supporter?

A Soil Supporter is someone who contributes their food and yard scraps to a Soil Site.

# What if I'm a novice Soil Maker? Can I still host a Soil Site?

Yes, absolutely. Remember that making soil - although essentially a very simple process - is a skill that very few people have so far developed. And since it’s so important for creating healthier, cohesive and resilient neighborhoods, there’s no better time than now to start learning.

You might want to let people know in the description of your Soil Site that you’re a novice and would love some help learning how to make soil. You’ll be surprised how happy people will be to help share their experience and expertise with you. And MakeSoil is also developing educational resources and support to all of our brave new Soil Makers joining the movement.

While you’re just getting started, you can also set your Soil Site as ‘Private’ - meaning Soil Supporters won’t start bringing their scraps to you until you approve them as participants. And you can set a limit to the number of Soil Supporters you accept (it could be as low as 1 or 2), so your Soil Site won’t get overwhelmed while you are still developing your soil-making skills.

# What if I live in an apartment complex? Can I still host a Soil Site?

Yes. An apartment complex can actually be an ideal place to start a Soil Site. In fact, our first ever Soil Site was started in an apartment complex!

In some cases, the property manager may be inspired to support you and may even want to become a Soil Maker of the Soil Site alongside you - which is great! In most cases though, it will be preferable for a resident to take ultimate responsibility for the Soil Site, without disturbing the property manager from carrying out their existing duties.

If you need to mitigate some typical concerns that a property manager may have, scroll down these FAQs to read answers to common questions including 'Will my pile smell bad?' and 'Will my pile attract pests e.g. rats?'

# What if I don’t have access to garden space? Where can I host a Soil Site?

There are lots of places where soil can be made, even in a dense city. Even if you don’t own any land or property yourself, you just need to be resourceful. After all, as you can see from the image of an urban Soil Site below, it doesn’t take much space to make soil. Could you get access to your neighbor’s yard, or a spare patch of nearby community land - perhaps some land that belongs to a church or local business?

# What if I travel a lot. Can I still be a Soil Maker?

Yes. It’s so important to make soil together, that we’ve designed the MakeSoil.org platform to be complementary with a diverse range of lifestyles - including that of today’s world traveller!

The platform facilitates good communication and builds trusted community around each Soil Site, so that even when you’re away, you can feel comfortable with people visiting your site.

If you choose to make your site ‘Private’, you can make sure that only individuals approved by you, the primary Soil Maker, can access and participate in your Soil Site as Soil Supporters.

You can also ‘promote’ a Soil Supporter in whom you have lots of trust, to become a fellow Soil Maker alongside you who can manage your site and its participants while you’re gone.

# Can a project or organization create and host one or more Soil Site(s)?

The platform is designed to support both individuals AND organizations to create and host one or more Soil Sites. If you are part of a soil-making project or organization, you can post your organization’s Soil Site(s) to our online map while retaining your own identity on the platform, including a link to your website and any social media pages, and also your contact details.

# Can I earn income as a Soil Maker?

We're finding that some neighbors are willing to support their Soil Makers with a monthly contribution for receiving their food scraps. Explore this with your neighbors.

We're also finding that artisanal soil is becoming a valuable product, which means that Soil Makers producing high-quality soil may be able to sell it.

# How can I make soil?

There are many different ways to make soil. However, we consider the thermophilic, microbial soil-making process - commonly referred to as ‘hot’ composting - to be the most versatile and robust. In this process, the Soil Site could ideally reach temperatures of around 130°F (54°C), supporting many different microbes as they voraciously chew and digest the materials in a Soil Site, which is what ultimately turns those materials into what we recognize as soil.

This ‘hot’ process is able to handle most typical household waste, as well as a diversity of inputs from neighbors and the surrounding community e.g. coffee shops, restaurants, workplaces etc.

Then there are 4 general principles to keep in mind when making soil:

<div style="overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%;position:relative;height:0;">
<iframe style="left:0;top:0;height:100%;width:100%;position:absolute;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuomHS3OMyo?rel=0&modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## 1) The Carbon to Nitrogen ratio

There should be 30 parts of carbon to every 1 part of nitrogen. Said another way, 3 parts ‘brown’ or ‘dry’ stuff (e.g. sawdust, dry leaves and paper) for every 1 part ‘green’ or ‘wet’ stuff (e.g. banana peels, apple cores, coffee grounds).

While that may sound daunting, it will quickly become intuitive: If it’s too moist and starting to smell, you need more high-carbon materials. If it’s dry and lifeless and not turning into soil, you need more high-nitrogen materials.

## 2) Airflow

There should be sufficient airflow through the pile, and generally the more, the better. This can be achieved, for instance, by ensuring that there are small gaps between the panels of your Soil Maker Box, or by having one side made of chicken wire.

## 3) Moisture

The pile should be sufficiently moist, but not too wet. Covering the pile or at the very least keeping a layer of high-carbon matter on top, will help prevent your pile from becoming dried out in hot, sunny conditions, or from becoming too moist when it rains.

If the pile remains too dry, either add more moist, high-nitrogen scraps (e.g. coffee grounds) or water.

## 4) Volume

One last point to consider is that you can’t make soil in a coffee cup! For a hot process, there needs to be a sufficient thermal mass - ensure your pile is at least a few feet in diameter.

# What materials CAN I make soil out of?

Essentially, you can make soil out of almost anything except metal, plastic or glass. However, different Soil Makers will likely have personal preferences and may not accept certain materials.

# Why do some Soil Makers NOT accept certain compostable materials?

Some Soil Makers don’t accept meat, grease, dairy, bones, cooked food, bread, pasta etc. With a high level of skill you can make soil out of any of these materials without any problems. However, it requires a Soil Maker who can achieve high temperatures with their pile, or else these materials may smell unpleasant or attract pests.

Some Soil Makers don’t accept citrus, onions or garlic. This is only a problem if they are using worms to digest the materials in their pile instead of a thermophilic (hot) process.

Many Soil Makers don’t accept glossy paper e.g. junk mail because they take a long time to break down and may contain metals or chemicals used in printing or laminating. For similar reasons, many Soil Makers don’t accept non-organic (conventionally grown) food-waste or commercial cigarette butts.

Many Soil Makers don’t accept human waste or pet waste, because they may contain parasites or diseases that cannot be reliably avoided except with the highest level of soil-making skill.

# How long will it take to make soil?

It will probably take at least 8 weeks before you have harvested your first batch of soil, although it’s possible you could do it in as little as 5 weeks.

We recommend a set-up where materials can continuously be added, and where soil can continuously be harvested from the bottom of the bin - such as the Soil Maker Box that we deisgned ourselves.

# Do I need any special equipment to make soil?

This depends what pests you have to guard against.

If you have no pests, then you don’t strictly need any special equipment. You could just mound up your scraps into a pile. However, you’ll need to keep your pile mounded, so you may soon find that some sort of container would be useful. With no pests, a simple contianer made from wooden pallets and some chicken wire is perfectly fine. If you have raccoons, you might need a closed container that can only be opened by a human.

# Will my pile smell bad?

Only if something is wrong. Maybe there’s too much nitrogen, not enough airflow, or it’s too wet. However, a well-managed pile should never smell bad.

<div style="overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%;position:relative;height:0;">
<iframe style="left:0;top:0;height:100%;width:100%;position:absolute;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLXJVsNfjvw?rel=0&modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

# Will my pile attract pests e.g. rats?

Possibly. Especially if your pile is not getting hot enough. When it’s hot, the materials are turning into soil too fast to attract pests, who will find it too uncomfortable to dig around in there anyway.

You can also protect against pests by burying your freshest scraps in the middle of your pile, covering your pile with a ‘carbon seal’ (e.g. soil and dry leaves), and making your container secure.

# How can I get more materials being contributed to my pile?

The most direct way is to go door-to-door in your neighbourhood and ask people to become Soil Supporters to your Soil Site, contributing their leftovers and scraps. If you don't find Soil Supporters amongst your neighbors, the next best thing would be to ask local coffee shops (coffee grounds), restaurants and grocery stores (food scraps/waste), carpenters (sawdust) or breweries. These places tend to yield lots of organic waste. You may start to see other opportunities around you too.

# When can I add more materials to my pile?

For hot composting, when you stop adding materials, the pile will cool down. So to keep the hot process going, the best way is to keep adding materials. Then you can also keep harvesting the finished soil continuously too.

# Should the pile get lots of sun?

Full sun can help the pile warm up in wintery places that get down to freezing. Otherwise full sun may dry out the pile and shorten the life of the Soil Maker Box.

In general, the Soil Maker Box should be in a pleasing spot that entices people to use it, whether sunny or in partial shade.

# Should the Soil Maker Box sit on organic material or have a concrete base? Would a bed of crushed shell work?

It can be good to have the contents of the Soil Maker Box in touch with the ground. However, to extend the life of the wood, it’s also good to prevent any of the wood from sitting directly on the ground.

Crushed shells, brick, or gravel under the wooden boards that may make up a wooden bin’s base would be ideal, with bare ground in the middle so the bin’s contents can touch the earth.

# How should I store my food scraps before taking them to a Soil Site?

Many people put their scraps in an air-tight, sealable container because they are worried about the scraps smelling bad. However, this actually makes the smell worse! Remember, when it comes to making soil (and storing scraps), the more airflow the better. If you have good airflow, the scraps can even go several days without smelling and will in fact soon begin to dry up a bit.

However, the scraps can attract small flies and so if you use an open container, it’s good to cover it with a breathable material (e.g. cheesecloth or a cotton/linen dishcloth). Alternatively, you can always keep your container in the refrigerator, or the freezer, depending on how long you need to wait before eventually taking your scraps to a Soil Site.

</div>

# What should I do with my finished soil?

Firstly, you won't end up with nearly as much as you think. However, once you've made some soil, you may want to grow something yourself e.g. a plant. It can be very rewarding to grow your own food, or even just indoor plants to liven up your living space. Otherwise, you will almost certainly have a neighbor or community garden nearby who would love to have some.

# How can I become the ultimate Soil Maker?

## Introduction

For us at MakeSoil, there is so much more to being a Soil Maker than just having a compost heap in your backyard. The Soil Maker is now emerging as an important new role in society. And as more people begin to discover the _economic_ opportunity around soil making, the ‘Soil Maker’ is even set to become one of the first regenerative jobs to go mainstream globally.

So here is a brief guide on how to become the _ultimate_ Soil Maker...

## 1) Just do it!

Don’t keep waiting for the perfect moment when you will _finally_ be ready to get started. The truth is, almost no culture in history has ever really figured out how to do soil making well. That means that very few human beings, relatively speaking, have ever been a Soil Maker! So don’t hesitate. Your planet and your community need you to act right now. Learn what you need to as you go, ‘on the job’. You will find that it will all become intuitive very quickly.

## 2) Create your Soil Site

If you haven’t already, find somewhere to build your pile. This could be as simple as a mound of scraps that you cover with a makeshift ‘lid’ to protect the heap from the rain. However, depending what pests you have to guard against, you might need something more.

To explore some options, please visit our [Soil Maker Box page](https://www.makesoil.org/the-soil-maker-box/) to find out more.

## 3) Choose the right place for your Soil Maker Box

MakeSoil wants to transform soil making from a backyard hobby into a front yard movement. The best way to do this, is to put your Soil Maker Box in a highly visible spot that is also accessible to the public. This way, people who are not even necessarily _participating_ in your Soil Site, will see what’s happening. People will stop and look. Conversations will take place. New thoughts and actions will be provoked. And that’s how your small act can build a movement!

You could even create your Soil Site at a community center (e.g. school, workplace, church, coffee shop, grocery store), since such places generate lots of compostable materials.

## 4) Create a nice profile of your Soil Site on the MakeSoil.org map

If you haven’t already, go to MakeSoil.org, create an account, verify your account, then click ‘Become a Soil Maker’ in the left side menu. This is where you add info about your Soil Site.

Try to accept as many compostable materials as possible. Once you’ve mastered the art of hot composting, you’ll be able to turn almost any typical household waste, and an impressive variety of inputs from nearby shops, restaurants and workplaces too, into healthy soil. And given the scale of our food waste and climate crisis, the more you can compost, the better!

Take a good quality photo of your Soil Site and add it to your Soil Site profile. And write a good description of your Soil Site, telling people who you are, and why you are making soil.

## 5) Get people to help you make soil

You will soon find that you can’t make much soil, if any, from just your own food scraps. You will need extra help from family, friends or neighbors who can contribute their scraps to you. Not only does this help you to make soil and reduce ‘waste’, but it also has the added benefit of creating more social links between the people in your household, street or neighborhood.

The most direct way to get ‘Soil Supporters’ contributing their scraps to your Soil Site, is to go door-to-door asking your neighbors ‘Will you help me to make soil? I need your scraps’. The key next step is to invite them to join your Soil Site on the MakeSoil.org platform itself.

You can invite people by email directly from your Soil Site page on the platform, or you can grab the link from your Soil Site page and share it on social media or local community websites like Meetup or Nextdoor, inviting people near you to become your Soil Supporters.

On your Soil Site page, you can also download and print a poster that you can laminate and place somewhere visible near your Soil Site to attract potential Soil Supporters who will walk by. And if you print two to a page, you can use it as a flyer to hand out in your neighborhood.

## 6) Master the art of soil making

To regenerate the planet, we don’t need every single person to become a Soil Maker. What we do need though, is at least one ‘master Soil Maker’ on every street or block - someone who takes responsibility for mastering the art of soil making, so that others don’t have to.

This means educating yourself on the 4 fundamental principles of soil making, and reading books like the Humanure Handbook that explore the full potential of soil making in depth. The rest will come through practice and experience, and exchanging with other Soil Makers.

## 7) Give your Soil Supporters the gift of ‘Earth empathy’

It turns out that when people see their food scraps turn into living soil (instead of just throwing them in the trash), it completes an essential feedback loop. You witness first-hand how the planet heals and renews itself. And you experience how our human lives can be harmonized with nature. This experience reprograms your consciousness for ‘Earth empathy’ - the sense that the planet is alive, and the natural desire to be kinder to the planet.

The _ultimate_ Soil Maker knows this secret, and thus encourages their Soil Supporters to have the full experience: (1) Bury your scraps in the heap yourself (2) Stop by the Soil Site occasionally to see how the soil making process is going (3) See and touch the finished soil.

## 8) Make good use of the MakeSoil.org platform

Like any project, a Soil Site only thrives when there is clear, regular communication between the people participating in it. That’s why it’s vital to use the MakeSoil platform to maintain good communication between you and your Soil Supporters. Need more greens for your pile right now? Want to remind people to peel off fruit stickers when they deposit their scraps? Want to make changes to what materials you accept and don’t accept? Let your Soil Supporters know such things by posting on your Soil Site message board, or by updating your Soil Site information panel. You can also send direct, private messages to other users.

## 9) Do something good with the soil you make

After all, what is the point of making soil if we can’t do something useful with it? Well, it turns out that soil is a hugely valuable resource. Use your finished soil to grow beautiful plants that can liven up your space, or nutritious food that nourishes you and your family or community. And if you have any extra, donate or sell it to your neighbors or nearest community garden.
